"""Consume Garnet Runtime Review evidence posted on the PR.

Garnet runs an eBPF sensor (Jibril) inside CI jobs and posts a sticky
"Garnet Runtime Review" comment on the PR: the execution tree recorded
while the PR's code actually ran — process lineage chains with the
outbound destinations each chain produced — keyed to the head commit via
an embedded `<!-- garnet:commit <sha> -->` marker. That gives stamphog
something no static reviewer has: kernel-recorded ground truth about what
a change *did* when it ran, not what its diff *looks like* it would do.

This module mirrors migration_risk.py's shape: a deterministic CI signal,
bound to the head commit, interpreted conservatively, feeding a scoped
deny-list bypass plus a TRUSTED prompt block for the LLM reviewer.

Grounding model — the execution tree is the evidence. There is no static
egress allowlist: every destination is judged by the process lineage that
produced it, in the context of the diff, by the LLM reviewer. The only
deterministic signals are integrity (trusted author, head-pinned,
parseable, non-empty) and the renderer's own comparison against the
previously profiled commit (new `+` chains).

Semantics (all fail toward "no bypass"):
    missing   → no Garnet comment for the current head, or a comment from
                which no execution tree could be parsed (waiting state, or
                a renderer format this parser doesn't understand);
                deny-list applies normally and the reviewer is told no
                usable runtime evidence exists.
    recorded  → an execution tree exists for the head commit (snapshot:
                no previous profiled commit to compare against). No
                bypass — with no comparison baseline the tree cannot
                attest that the change left the workload unchanged; the
                full tree still reaches the LLM reviewer in-prompt.
    unchanged → an execution tree exists and the renderer's comparison
                against the previously profiled commit shows no genuinely
                new workload destinations. Scoped bypass: a
                deps_toolchain-only deny may proceed to LLM review (never
                auto-approve). A `+` chain whose destination was already
                recorded (in the unchanged or removed set of the same
                comment) is a RESHAPED chain — the same destination under
                a different process lineage, which installer
                nondeterminism produces run to run. Reshaped chains never
                diverge on their own. `+` chains rooted in the runner
                substrate (systemd-rooted provisioning, no recorded
                workflow step) are runner churn, not workload divergence —
                they never diverge either, but both are still reported to
                the reviewer.
    diverged  → the comparison shows at least one genuinely NEW workload
                destination versus the previously profiled commit. No
                bypass. "New" is an observation; "unexpected" is the
                reviewer's judgment against the diff — the new chains are
                handed to the LLM reviewer as advisory context with
                showstopper guidance, not turned into a deterministic
                refusal.

Trust model: only comments authored by the configured Garnet bot logins
are read, the commit marker must equal the PR head SHA (a stale comment
from an earlier push is ignored), and the configuration lives in
`.stamphog/runtime-evidence.yml` (trusted, human-reviewed via the
stamphog_policy deny which covers `.stamphog/**`).

    Whenever runtime evidence existed for the reviewed head, the verdict
    comment carries the exact commit binding, the recorded execution
    chains (with any chain new versus the previously profiled commit
    called out), and the Garnet public run permalinks — so anyone can
    independently verify the kernel-recorded execution tree the verdict
    relied on, without re-running anything.
